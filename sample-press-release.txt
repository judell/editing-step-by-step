Remcoms' XFdtd EM Simulation Software supports diplex-matched antennas, and enables designers to work faster

XFdtd’s schematic editor, a novel electromagnetic simulation tool, combines matching network analysis with full-wave results. It's ideal for complex antenna designs that involve multi-state and multi-port aperture or impedance tuners, and for corporate feed networks with digital phase shifters.

The latest release of the schematic editor adds antenna configurations and includes shortcuts -- notably the ability to connect two voltage sources to a single antenna --  that streamline analysis of a matching network’s impact on FDTD results. Designers can now easily compute system and radiation efficiencies for diplex-matched antennas from a single schematic. They can also now compute average SAR for dynamically-tuned antennas that use multi-port impedance and aperture tuners, and use new microstrip models and substrate definitions to improve the fidelity of simulation.

Additional updates are aimed at fostering a more intuitive and collaborative experience for engineering teams. XFdtd now incorporates frequency bands showcasing the benefit of the FDTD method for producing many broadband results using a single run. Most commonly used bands are included in the Frequency Band Library to streamline user input. Users can also define their own custom bands and add them to the library, import bands from external files, and export bands.
